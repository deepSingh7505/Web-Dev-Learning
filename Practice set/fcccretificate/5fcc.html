            <h1>Introdution</h1>
            <p>Red Bull Racing is one of the most successful and high-profile teams in modern Formula 1 history. For the
                2026 F1 season, the team — officially called Oracle Red Bull Racing — has entered a new era marked by
                technical regulation changes, a fresh driver lineup, and a major shift in their powertrain strategy as
                F1 introduces completely restructured engines and aerodynamic rules.</p>

            <h1>Explaination</h1>
            <p>
            <h3>🏁 New Team Dynamics</h3>

            In 2026, Red Bull Racing keeps Max Verstappen, the four-time world champion, as their lead driver.

            Joining him is Isack Hadjar, promoted from their junior sister squad, Racing Bulls, replacing Yuki
            Tsunoda as full-time teammate.

            Tsunoda remains with the team in a test and reserve driver role, supporting development efforts.

            <h3>⚙️ Technical Shifts</h3>

            2026 sees huge changes in F1 regulations, especially the power unit. New engines have much more
            electrical power and are designed for a roughly 50/50 split between combustion and hybrid systems.

            Red Bull and sister team Racing Bulls have transitioned to using Red Bull Ford power units, marking
            Ford’s return to Formula 1 as an engine partner.

            <h3>💡 Season Preparations</h3>

            Red Bull unveiled its 2026 car and livery (design and visual look) in Detroit, USA, showing a refreshed
            branding with a white heritage theme and the iconic Red Bull logo.

            The team has begun pre-season testing at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya in Spain, a key step to
            fine-tune the new car under real track conditions.</p>

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>For the 2026 Formula 1 season, Red Bull Racing steps into a bold new chapter. With updated technical
                rules, a stronger focus on hybrid power, and a fresh driver pairing of Verstappen with rising star
                Hadjar, the team is striving to regain its championship-winning form. While the sport evolves
                technically and competitively, Red Bull remains a benchmark for performance and innovation in F1.</p>
